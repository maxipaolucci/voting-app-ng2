#A voting sample app with Angular2 and Redux

Another boilerplate to start developing web applications without loose time doing server and client configuration. Go directly to the core and avoid the boring stuff.

###The server is:
* an ExpressJS app
* enabled REST webservices and websocket communication.
* Redux
* Mocha, chai and supertest for testing. (Supertest to test webservices).

###The client includes by default:
* Angular 2
* Redux (ng2-redux, DevToolsExtension, redux-logger)
* Bootstrap 3
* Gulp for building tasks.
* Webpack to bundle resources and serve the webapp.
* SASS to manage stylesheets.
* Mocha and chai for test.


##Setup

1) run `>git clone https://github.com/maxipaolucci/voting-app-ng2.git`

2) Install node and npm in your pc (to check if you already have it installed do `>npm --version`  and  `>node --version`)


###Server Setup

3.1) Go to server directory and run `>npm install`

3.2) Start the server doing: `>npm start`  (the server runs in port 3030)

3.3) Run the test cases: `>npm run test`


###Client Setup

4.1) Install webpack-dev-server and gulp npm packages globally to have access to these
from the command line: `>npm install -g webpack-dev-server gulp`

4.1) Go to client directory and run `>npm install`

4.3) Start the development environment doing: `>gulp start` or `>gulp`
    This starts the webpack-dev-server
    The webpack-dev-servers has watchers for js and SASS files (inside src/app) with auto-refresh on browser.

4.4) Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

####More GULP commands
1) Start the development environment: `>gulp` or `>gulp start`

2) Run the tests scripts doing: `>gulp test`

3) Create a build under /dist directory doing: `>gulp build`
